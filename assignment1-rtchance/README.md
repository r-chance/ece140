# assignment1

Congratulations on your new job at FaceSpace.

In recent weeks, our customers have been complaining that some users are seeing comments that
contain unsavory language.

Your assignment is to write a profanity filter function that removes unsavory terms from posted comments so that
children and others who are easily offended don't get upset.

Our framework will iteratively read lines of sample user-input from a file, and send the input to your function. Your
function will process the input, and replace objectionable words with a randomly generated string of characters
from a list of characters you will be given at runtime. We'll also provide you with a list of words we consider to be
objectionable. Keep in mind that some persistent users try to find sneaky ways to inject unsavory words into comments.
Your solution should be robust enough to catch these variations.

## Additional requirements
1. Make sure to document all pre/post conditions, functional operations, input and return values
2. Also make sure to provide a robust set of tests to confirm your code works as expected

## How You're Graded
1. At a minimum, your filter needs to work to simply replace unsavory words from the input string.
2. More points are awarded to solutions that handle the trickier cases that occur later in the text file.
3. Your code needs to be easy to read and understand. Simple, clear code is better.
4. Speed matters. The faster your code runs, the more points you earn. How can this be sped up?

##Submission Instructions
1. Due on Sunday, January 15.
2. Modify just the profanity.py file, and leave all the .txt in your directory.
3. Be sure to commit and push your changes prior to the deadline.

Programming tip: Simple, readable code is nearly always preferable because it's easier to understand, modify,
debug and share.

Good luck and welcome to FaceSpace!
