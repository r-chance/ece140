# Web Mad-Libs

In this assignment, you will write a mad-lib style business model for the “Four Horsemen of the Economic Apocalypse”: Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Tesla.

Careful -- it’s harder than it looks! There is a catch, though! You’ll be doing it with interactivity on the web!

Here’s what’s required:

1. An HTML page with 4 buttons (one for each of the of the horsemen)

2. A CSS file applying custom styling to each of the buttons
    - Maybe apply branding colors? Be free to be creative here!
    
3. A JS file that captures button clicks (just like we demonstrated in class last lecture) and then reveals the appropriate mad-lib for the corresponding company (HINT: remember opacity?)
    - There are lots of ways to get this done, but do not use any external libraries or packages. We want you to get your feet wet with these languages.
