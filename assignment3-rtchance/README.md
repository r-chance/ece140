# The Case of The Persistent Pioneer</dt>

If you have not yet seen the movie "Hidden Figures", it tells the story of a group of African-American female mathematicians that served as "human computers" who helped NASA put astronauts into space. Sadly, we can't find an online copy of the Curriculum Vitae for any of these incredible women. Your task is to create a CV in HTML for one of the following candidates:

1. Ada Byron King
2. Grace Hopper
3. Adele Goldberg
4. Sister Mary Kenneth Keller
5. Erna Schneider Hoover
6. Dorothy Vaughan (NASA)
7. Barbara Liskov
8. Frances E. Allen


## Your submission must include each of the following elements

- An HTML Table that gives their personal demographic data
- An ordered list of academic achievements they earned
- An un-ordered list of the jobs they held during their lifetime
- A free-form paragraph (or 3) describing what you found inspiring about your candidate
- Your submission must also include CSS rules for the lists and paragraphs
- Extra point: If you're up for it, add some css to tweak your tables!

Submit your work by creating an html document called cv.html, and save that in your copy of the assignment on github.
