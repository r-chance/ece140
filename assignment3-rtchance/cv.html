<p>I found Grace Hopper to be inspiring for many reasons. First, she loved her country enough to serve during World War II, even after being denied enlistment in the active Navy. While most people would have given up after being denied enlistment, she retired as an Admiral instead. Next, she was a brilliant woman who helped develop modern compilers and programming languages. And finally, she devoted herself to a life full of learning and teaching others. I find all of these to be admirable qualities of the Admiral.</p>

<p>Rear Admiral Grace Hopper died on January 1, 1992, and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors. She was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama on November 22, 2016. She is also honored with her name on the guided-missile destroyer USS Hopper as well as the Department of Energy's Cray XE6 "Hopper" supercomputer.</p>
